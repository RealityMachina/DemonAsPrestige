# DemonAsPrestige
Take these powers of the abyss and make them your own. Be stylish with them, even.

Basically re-implements the Demon Mythic Path as the Demonic Hunter prestige class available to Legends. Note that this comes with a major caveat: while you're still allowed to pick abilities and feats reliant on mythic rank bonuses, they will do far less compared to an actual mythic path.

You're not going down the same route as an actual Demon mythic, after all.

You can remove the requirement that Demonic Hunter requires both the player character and the PC being a Legend through the Unity Mod Manager in-game menu.  For obvious reasons, doing this while using another mythic path may break your game and I won't take responsibility for it.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Demonic Hunter mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. 

SwizzleWizzle and their WorldCrawl mod, since I needed the extra help in understanding what the game wanted in order to implement a new class.
